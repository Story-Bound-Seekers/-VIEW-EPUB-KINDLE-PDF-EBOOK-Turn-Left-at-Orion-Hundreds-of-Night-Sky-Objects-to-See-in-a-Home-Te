Title: Best tour of the galaxy and beyond
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 6, 2019
Review: Once you are an experienced star gazer you can make up your own agenda for night sky viewing, but this book is absolutely the best guide for the beginner. It tells you what interesting things you can see, how to find them in the sky, what you can expect to see with a large or small telescope and why it is worth looking at it. It gives advice about what filters to use and whether it will be easy or hard to find. The book is also organized by seasons, so you don't go looking for something at the wrong time of year. Also has a good introductory section on getting to know your telescope, the moon and the planets. One of three absolutely essential references for starting out, the other two being maps - the Celestron Star map is excellent and the Cambridge Star Atlas is a favorite.

Title: Big hit as a Christmas present
Date: Reviewed in the United States on December 30, 2020
Review: My brother-in-law is an amateur astronomer who has built his own telescope. I got this as a Christmas present for him and he called on Christmas Day raving about it and how useful and helpful he expects it to be. So it was a big hit as a present. As I know next to nothing about astronomy, I can't comment on the book otherwise.
Edit: Several weeks later, I got this from my brother-in-law:
You sent this book to me for Christmas. Just to let you know that I have been reading through it bit by bit at lunchtime for about a month. I like several things about it: 1) it describes how best to "star hop" to the object which I need to do with the type of telescope mount I have (I call it a "push and shove" mount.) 2) it provides interesting tidbits of info like actual size and distance and sometimes a bit of history like "this star was the original Cepheid variable" 3) I was especially delighted to find a several page table of binary stars listing their magnitudes and minutes of separation. I have not been able to find this info elsewhere. I will make use of it to try to separate binaries that are at the observable separation limit of my telescope 4) it has a very fine guide to many interesting features on the moon including Apollo landing sites, etc. and 5) reading through it whets one appetite to go out and do some observing! Thanks so much for his very interesting gift!

Title: This should come as a standard accessory to your first telescope
Date: Reviewed in the United States on November 4, 2015
Review: I've been looking at the stars for over 30 years and have a shelf full of books that I use to help people learn the night sky. Other than R.A. Rey's "The Stars" this is the one book I tell people is a MUST OWN. I give talks on how to buy a telescope at the local library and at outreach events and tell people that after the fee for joining the local Astronomy club, this book should be the first thing they buy.

When people first get a telescope they quickly realize how big the sky is, and how hard it is to find things to look at other than the moon and the naked-eye visible planets. The new scope then sits and collects hats and jackets until eventually ending up on Craigslist or at a yard sale. Please, don't do that. Get this book with a good pair of binoculars and/or your first telescope, learn the sky and find some neat objects that most people will only see via the internet.

Title: Must buy book for first time telescope owners
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 17, 2021
Review: I don't normally write product reviews, however, this book deserves one. I've bought my first telescope (which hasn't arrived yet) and got this book in preparation for night viewing. I'm not familiar with where things are in the night sky so I dove into this book as soon as I received it. I assumed I would need to start studying and figuring out where the constellations are before I could use it. Wrong! The authors make finding objects so simple, a child could do it. I can take this book out with me (along with my red light flashlight) and find things to observe without any studying or planning ahead if I so choose. The main stars to locate in each section are easy to identify and find with their instructions. The way they walk you to the area of the sky to point your scope to is impressive. The only thing simpler than this book would be if they came and directed my telescope themselves. I'm extremely confident & excited to get my telescope now. I can very simply turn to the current span of months in the book, tell if my type of scope will be able to pick up said object, and use the recommended eyepiece.

I hope the authors know how much they have enabled some of us to see the beauty of the night sky. Without this book, I'm not sure I would have found even a 10th of the items listed. If you need help finding objects to look at with your scope, buy this book. It will not disappoint!!

Title: Best book for beginning astronomer--Indispensable
Date: Reviewed in the United States on January 5, 2017
Review: If you're looking for a book that will let you figure out what to focus your scope on, you can't go wrong with this book. In fact, I wish I'd purchased it first when I was looking for books on astronomy. The book is organized by seasons, so you can turn to the winter season, for example, and get information on what might be the best sights to search for in the heavens. The authors show what you will really see through your telescope, instead of those beautiful Hubble-like pictures which you won't see unless you have a very large telescope, and there are in-depth descriptions on how to locate the objects and what you can expect to see. They even go through what you might see with simple tools like binoculars and if you'll only see the object under truly dark skies or if it's bright enough to see under moderately light-polluted skies.

This book now goes with me whenever I take my telescope out--in fact it is part of my "kit" that includes my observation log and drawing book. I honestly can't imagine going out without it anymore. When I plan an evening's list of targets to observe, this is the first book I drag out and read through. I frankly think it is indispensable, particularly for a beginning astronomer like me..
